MOD installation file.  Do so at your own risk

Installation direction for phpNuke 7.7 - 7.9, nukeEvo 2.0.x:
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) The first step is to install phpBBGarage
   Follow the instructions in './Install Garage phpNuke.txt'.

2) If you would like the 'Thumbnails' add-on, simply copy the files in 
   contrib/thumbnail_mod/root/*.*' to your 'modules/Forums' 
   directory

Install notes for phpNuke 7.6, phpNuke Platinum
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Follow the installation directions for phpNuke 7.7 - 7.9

2) In mainfile.php, find "$dbi = sql_connect($dbhost, $dbuname, $dbpass, $dbname);" and before it add:
define('NUKE_FILE', true);

This must be done before you open browser to http://<yoursite>/modules.php?name=Forums&file=install_garage

3) In modules/Forums/garage.php, remove this block of code:from the top

if ( defined('NUKE_FILE') && !defined('MODULE_FILE') )
{
	die("You can't access this file directly...");
}

and replace it with

if (!eregi("modules.php", $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']))
{
        die ("You can't access this file directly...");
}
